# GBDK example program

This is a simple program to test using GBDK and to act as a template - https://gbdk-2020.github.io/gbdk-2020/

To use this you will need to follow the instructions to install GBDK. Note this 
was developed on linux. make.sh Will not work on Windows and you will need to 
write a batch script with similar instructions for the same effect as this.
Alternatively you could use WSL to run this.
